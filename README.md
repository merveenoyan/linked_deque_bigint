# "Make Your Own Data Structure to Solve BigInt" Project 
My last minute term project with full of to-do's and OOP disasters.
* Write Operator Overload for Direct Support for Operators
* Negative Numbers Support
* Cleaner Tests
* Better OOP design (create "BigInt" as a class inside the LinkedDeque instead)
